------------------------------------------
+ The following project is an implemen-  +
+ tation of a simple visual cryptography +
+ technique on image files in black and  +
+ white color profile.                   +
+ The algorithm takes as an input the    +
+ address of a black and white image in  +
+ square pixel dimensions in ".bmp" file +
+ format.                                +
+ The algorithm produces three outputs:  +
+ an image file named "share1.bmp", an   +
+ image file named "share2.bmp" and an   +
+ image file named "decrypted.bmp".      +
+ Meanings of the files are implied by   +
+ their names.                           +

+ 0. The folder "bitmap-master" contains +
+    the library used to load/save       +
+    images.                             +
+ 1. The folder named "src" contains the +
+    sample images.                      +
+ 2. The ".cpp" file named "vis-cry.cpp" +
+    contains the source code.           +
+ 3. Compile and run the output file.    +
+ 4. After execution of the file, you'll +
+    be prompted to input the image file +
+    name. (in ".bmp" format)            +
+    For example, you can enter          +
+    "src/git.bmp" without the quotes.   +
+ 5. Feed the complete path of the file  +
+    with the name of the file with the  +
+    ".bmp" file extension.              +
+ 6. After you hit "Enter", the fed      +
+    image will undergo encryption and   +
+    two share files named "share1.bmp"  +
+    and "share2.bmp" will be created.   +
+ 7. In decryption, the share files are  +
+    loaded and then are decrypted. The  +
+    decrypted file is then saved as     +
+    "decrypted.bmp".                    +
